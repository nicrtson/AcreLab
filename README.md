# AcreLab
AcreLab is creating an affordable, rugged, open source framework of nodes that measure the surrounding environment. These nodes will be used by gardeners, farmers, homeowners and anyone else who want easily accessable data about the land they use and live on. AcreLab nodes will help optimize resource allocation and greatly reduce the use of our finite natural resources.
